It's Not This
Bearson & Lemaitre
2018

A man's dream is a brand new car
A drop top F-type Jaguar
We look for heaven, but it's not this
We look for heaven, but it's not this
Walk-in closet, thousand shoes
Cold Champagne in the afternoon
We look for heaven, but it's not this
We look for heaven, but it's not this

I've been dreaming
All my life been looking for that new thing
We look for heaven, but it's not this
We look for heaven, but it's not this

Beauty queen, it's a soft galore
A big ass house with a big ass pool
Look for a place that don't exist
We look for heaven, but it's not this
It doesn't matter what you've got
Or if you ever lost you take a shot
We look for heaven, but it's not this
We look for heaven, but it's not this

We look for heaven, but it's not this
We look for heaven, but it's not this

Dominos they fall inside my head
I don't see 'em now, maybe later
I am on a crater on the moon
Leaving soon, leaving room
For this natural disaster
You just have to visualize cotton candy in the sky
Lemon party in disguise
We look for heaven, but it's not this

We look for heaven, but it's not this

We look for heaven, but it's not this
